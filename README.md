# Predictive-Modelling-of-Housing-Prices-Using-CRISP-DM-in-R
This project applies the CRISP-DM framework to a structured housing dataset to forecast **property sale prices** and evaluate price appreciation potential. Using R programming, multiple regression models were developed and evaluated, with the final model selected based on performance metrics and business alignment.
